# Core
*Harigami* is a flyer. The concept is straightforward, it's about distributing the digital world.

# Target
Our main focus is on the wild artists; skaters, dancers, photographers, and so on.

They create events from their exciting daily activities, sometimes for free, sometimes with free beer. Their identity is supported by the local people in the wild.

# Mission
- Join the world culture phenomenon and engage in fun activities.
- Create a digital space for your own activities.

# dapp

Solana NFT is ubiquitous.

We leverage the Instagram network.

Our DAO serves as a scam prevention mechanism using logarithmically random mini-publics.

### Details (current)

We use the Core Candy Machine v3 to mint NFTs at a very low cost (Solana mirrors the real world).

We create multisig using the Squads SDK.

The treasury is managed by the minter until the event is settled.

# Next Steps

- introduce a distributor royalty program.
- interface their own digital space using Solid POD.

# Why this project?
I've seen the scene.

Take, for example, one of the top youth skate crews.

**They transitioned from Youtube back to DVD**

They discovered that 'free' can't provide a livelihood. They should be allowed to evolve while staying true to their roots.
